# 🧪 Week 2 Assignment: Functional Testing Lab — Note-Taking App

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this assignment, you will:

- Learn how to test if a small app works correctly  
- Try three types of testing: Unit, Integration, and System  
- Report any bugs (problems) you find using GitHub Issues  
- Write a short report to explain what you tested and what you found  

---

## 📦 What’s Inside This Project

- `index.html`: A simple note-taking app  
- `tests/`: Folder where you will write your test code using **Jest**  
- `Test_Report.md`: A file where you’ll summarize your work  

> 💡 You will **run the app in your browser** and write tests using **Jest** (a JavaScript testing tool).

---

## 🧪 What You Need to Do

### 1. Unit Testing — Test One Function
- Open `index.html` and look for the `saveNote()` function in the script  
- Write a test for this function using Jest (check what happens when the note is saved)  
- Example: What if the title or content is empty?

### 2. Integration Testing — Test Connected Features
- Test how the app behaves when a user types a note and clicks "Save Note"  
- Check if the note appears correctly on the page  
- This shows if different parts of the app are working together

### 3. System Testing — Test the Whole Flow
- Try the full process:  
  1. Write a note  
  2. Save it  
  3. Edit the note  
  4. Delete the note  
- Check if everything works from start to finish

## 🐞 How to Report Bugs

- If you find any problem or error, create a **GitHub Issue**  
- You must create **at least 3 Issues**  
- Add the label `functional` to each issue  

---

## 📝 What to Submit

1. ✅ Your test files in the `tests/` folder  
2. ✅ At least 3 GitHub Issues you created  
3. ✅ A `Test_Report.md` file that includes:

### 👇 Answer These Questions in `Test_Report.md`

---

### **1. Unit Test**
- What function did you test?
- What did your test check for?
- Did you find any bugs?

---

### **2. Integration & System Tests**
- What steps did you test (e.g., write → save → show)?
- What worked well? What didn’t?
- What bugs did you find?

---

### **3. Reflection**
- Was anything confusing or hard to test?
- How did you figure out what to test?
- What did you learn from this activity?
